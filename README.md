# Tutorial: Constrained Optimizaton with SciPy, GEKKO/APOPT and IPOPT
The code contains examples of optmization using available open-source packages.
## Installation of dependencies
SciPy, IPOPT and GEKKO can be installed through pip by running the following in the terminal:\
`python -m pip install --upgrade scipy`\ 
`pip install --upgrade ipyopt`\
`pip install --upgrade gekko`\ 
## Description of files
Objective function, constraints and their derivatives are included in `objective_function.py` and `constraints.py`. Files `optimization_scipy.py`, `optimization_ipopt.py` and `optimization_gekko_apopt.py` contain examples of using the libraries to solve the optimization problem.
